Description of contents: This deposit includes the cleaned, filtered and 
	phase folded NICER event data set for the millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR 
	J0030+0451 in the 0.25-3 keV band. The data processing and filtering 
	was performed using HEASoft 6.25.1 and NICERDAS version 5.0; the 
	specific parameters and filtering criteria used are detailed in the ApJ 
	Letter listed above. This event list was used to produce what is shown 
	for PSR J0030+0451 in Figures 2, 3, and 4 in the accepted ApJ Letter 
	listed above and was also used for the mass-radius and equation of state 
	inference analyses presented in the companion papers (Miller et al. 2019, 
	Riley et al. 2019, and Raaijmakers et al. 2019).
    
    The event file and its MD5 checksum is: 
    
    J0030+0451_merged_phase_0.25-3keV.fits (463bbac7203bb45bb02ea0deed49f083)
    

System requirements: The event list is provided in Flexible Image Transport System 
 (FITS) format, which can be read using the CFITSIO libraries of C and Fortran, the 
 astropy.io.fits module in Python, or the FTOOLS software package available from 
 the HEASARC (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/ftools_menu.html).

Additional comments: The original unfiltered NICER data set that was used to obtain
 the cleaned data set provided here is publicly available for download from the 
 HEASARC. The cleaned file provided preserves all necessary FITS header keywords, 
 event list columns, and the table of good time intervals. The column PULSE_PHASE
 gives the pulsar rotational phase for each event, obtained by folding the data at 
 the pulsar ephemeris, as described in the ApJ Letter.
